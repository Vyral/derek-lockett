What is title insurance and why is it important? Find out with this quick message.

People always ask me, “What the @\#\*% is title insurance?”&nbsp;

To be honest, there was a time in my life when I didn’t know the answer to this question, either. But now that I do, I’d like to share it with all of you today.&nbsp;

Before I can explain what title insurance is, however, I first need to explain what a title is and what a title company does.&nbsp;

In short, **a title is a legal document that declares you to be the rightful owner of a piece of property, and which outlines the rights you have as the owner.** Having title on a property gives you the right to alter, update, or even sell the property (so long as you do so using the correct legal channels).

A title company, meanwhile, is the entity that handles the transfer of title during a real estate sale. The role of a title company is to facilitate a legal transfer and also to check for any issues with the title that might interfere with the sale. If you took out a loan to upgrade the roof and haven’t yet fully paid it off, for example, this would pose a problem. And this is just one of the many potential issues home sellers can encounter.&nbsp;

With all of that out of the way, let’s get back to our main question: **What is title insurance, and why is it necessary?&nbsp;**

Simply put, title insurance is a policy that offers protection against unexpected issues related to your property’s title. While the title search performed by your title company should identify any such problems beforehand, certain things can slip by undetected.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
