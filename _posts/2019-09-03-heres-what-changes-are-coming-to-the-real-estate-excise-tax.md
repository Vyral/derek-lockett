<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The excise tax you pay during your home sale will be changing starting January 1, 2020.</em></p>

For quite a while now, the real estate excise tax (REET) home sellers pay during their sale has been 1.78% across the board, but changes are coming, and things are getting a bit more complicated.&nbsp;

**On January 1, 2020, the rate sellers owe for their excise tax will be based on their home’s purchase price, and that in itself will be divided into four tiers:**

* $500,000 or less: 1.6%
* Between $500,000 and $1 million: 1.79%
* Between $1.5 million and $3 million: 3.25%
* $3 million and above: 3.5%

It isn’t as simple as being taxed the highest rate that applies to you for the entirety of the purchase price, though. **You’ll also be taxed at different rates within those tiers.** For example, if you sell for $2 million, the first $500,000 of that will be taxed at 1.6%, the next $1 million will be taxed at 1.78%, and the final $500,000 will be taxed at 3.25%. When you add all three of those numbers up, that will be your final excise tax.&nbsp;

So, will you pay more or less in excise tax after January 1, 2020? If you sell your property for $1.55 million or less, you’ll pay anywhere from $900 to $100 less. If you sell anywhere above $1.55 million, you’ll pay more. In the $2 million price point, you’ll pay $6,450 more. In the $3 million price point, you’ll pay $21,150 more.&nbsp;

If you refinance your house or add someone to the title, you’ll also have to pay the excise tax, so if you’re curious what you’ll have to pay in this scenario, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help you.&nbsp;
