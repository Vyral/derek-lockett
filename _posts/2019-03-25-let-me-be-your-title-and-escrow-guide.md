*If you’ve got questions about the real estate process, we’ve got the answers you need.*

If you’ve been involved in real estate in any way in the last few years, you don’t need me to tell you that **the industry is changing rapidly.** Thanks to the internet, buyers and sellers now have more information than ever before regarding the ins and outs of real estate. 

Beyond that, iBuyers and other disruptors have emerged onto the scene. In short, real estate today is virtually unrecognizable to what things were like even just a decade ago. 

But even with all of these changes taking place, there are still a couple of things that remain constant: title and escrow. In fact, title and escrow have stayed so consistent that even those of us within the industry are beginning to tire of the same old song and dance.

That’s exactly why I’m here today. **I’m Derek Lockett, owner and founder of Derek Locket Title and Escrow, and I’m ready to shake things up.** I plan to bring you relevant, helpful, and, most importantly, easy-to-understand content that cuts straight to the point. 

Our goal is twofold. First, we want to help buyers and sellers become knowledgeable of the real estate process by using language you can actually understand, and, second, we want to help our fellow real estate professionals bring their service into the modern world. 

My team and I are excited to start delivering these bite-sized messages to you. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
