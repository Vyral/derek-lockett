<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’ve got questions about the real estate process, we’ve got the answers you need.</em></p>

**Real estate is changing rapidly these days.&nbsp;**

But even with all of these changes taking place, title and escrow have stayed so consistent that even professionals within the industry are beginning to tire of the monotony.
