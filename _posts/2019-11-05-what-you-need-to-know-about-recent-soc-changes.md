<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There were recently some changes made to SOC policy in our Northwest MLS. Let’s recap what they mean for you, today.</em></p>

By now you’ve probably heard of the Selling Office Commission (SOC) changes that took place in the Northwest MLS as of October, but what are they, and what do they mean for you?

Simply put, **SOC is the amount offered by the listing agent and seller to the buyer’s agent commission.** If you weren’t already aware, it’s common practice for the seller to cover the commission fee for both their own agent and the buyer’s agent during a real estate transaction.&nbsp;

With that said, let’s get back to the recent SOC changes. It just so happens that I was recently fortunate enough to sit in on a meeting with Justin Hagg (the general counsel for the Northwest MLS), during which he explained these changes.&nbsp;

The main motivating factor behind these changes was to increase the level of transparency surrounding the commission being offered to buyer’s agents. **This spawned two changes:&nbsp;**

1\. Sellers can now publish their SOC.
<br>2\. Sellers are no longer required to offer to pay for the buyer’s commission.&nbsp;

Now, in regards to that last point specifically, I know some of you may be thinking: Wait a minute, buyers are going to have to start paying commission fees\!?

Not necessarily.&nbsp;

While this certainly could be the case for some buyers, the truth is that we just don’t fully know how these changes will impact our market. No other MLS in the country has taken these steps, so there’s really no telling what the future holds.

It might comfort you to know, though, that even when sellers were required to offer some amount toward the buyer’s commission, that amount was never stipulated. Sellers could always have chosen to give just one penny toward the buyer’s commission. When you put it that way, **the difference between being required to give at least one penny and not being required to give any money at all really doesn’t seem all that extreme.&nbsp;**

In fact, there is also currently a rule in place that states that buyer’s agents don’t have to show their clients properties where the seller has refused to offer compensation toward their commission.

For this reason, many agents have begun to encourage their buyers to start using forms 41A and 41B—**buyer representation agreements that allow agents to set a commission fee amount they must receive by the end of the deal.** This fee can be paid by the buyer, the seller, or a combination of the two.&nbsp;

Form 41C and Rule 104(D) also both allow for buyers agent to negotiate compensation with the seller.&nbsp;

This doesn’t mean, however, that buyer’s agents aren’t required to show properties where the seller is offering a lower SOC than what the buyer’s agent expects to be paid in commission. This would only be the case if an additional contract was drafted and signed.&nbsp;

Hopefully this has cleared some things up. Of course, I don’t have all the answers on how these changes will play out. No one does. I do have a lot of resources, though, so if you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious how a specific scenario might play out, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
