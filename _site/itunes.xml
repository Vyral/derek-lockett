If you’ve got questions about the real estate process, we’ve got the answers you need.

Real estate is changing rapidly these days. 

But even with all of these changes taking place, title and escrow have stayed so consistent that even professionals within the industry are beginning to tire of the monotony.

“We want to help buyers and sellers to better understand real estate.”

That’s exactly why I’m here today. I’m Derek Lockett, your Title and Escrow guide, and I’m ready to shake things up. I plan to bring you relevant, helpful, and easy-to-understand content that cuts straight to the point. 

Our goal is twofold. We want to help buyers and sellers to better understand real estate and we want to help real estate professionals modernize their service. 

My team and I are excited to start delivering these bite-sized messages to you. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
